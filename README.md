# Farmer Customer Connect
## Main Objective
The main objective of this project is to provide an online platform for both farmers and customers where customers can purchase goods from farmers directly.

## Project Description
The Farmer Customer Connect is a web application and an E-Commerce website which can be used by both farmers and customers to buy and sell vegetables, dairy products, fruits etc. In this Web application farmers can register themselves and sell their produce at a suitable price. Customers can also buy various vegetables, dairy products, and fruits from their home for a nominal price. This Web application connects both farmer’s and customer’s digitally making it easier for farmers to sell their products at ease without any intermediate buyers. This Web application mainly aims to remove the middlemen so that the farmer’s can sell their products at a suitable price.

## Problems faced by farmers and customers in general
Many Farmers are ending up in losses because they are unable to find a better price for their product at the regional market. The interference of the middlemen is one of the major problems the farmer’s facing nowadays. The similar applies to the customer too, due to the interference of the middlemen the customer’s end up buying various products for too much price. To eradicate this problem we are working on this “Farmer Customer Connect'' web application.
